Welcome to Paper Foxan! This is the repo for the Paper Mario (N64) romhack, Paper Foxan. Paper Foxan is a mod of which replaces everything and stars Foxan as he goes on a quest to defeat Bowser of which took over Town Town Kingdom due to being done with Mario. This mod is planned (at least atm) to include 8-9 full chapters, with one of them being a Pit of 129 Trials. This mod plans to include many new mechanics as well. We also have a discord server! Here's the link!
